# Restaurant Finance Analytics (Income Statement) (Sales/Expenses)
This project simulates a data analytics solution for a small restaurant.  
I designed a AWS environment (VPC, subnets, Security Groups, Ec2), gathered data with AI workflows, cleaned data from different sources (Pyspark and Pandas), designed a OLTP database (Postgres), wrote SQL queries, and built dashboards to analyze sales, costs, and profitability (Power BI & Excel).

## Goals
- Track weekly and monthly revenue
- Identify the main sales channels
- Identify the all types of expesnses (Cost of Sales, Operating Expenses, Taxes and Interests)
- Support business decisions with clear dashboards and insights

## Tech Stack
- SQL (e.g. SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- Python (pandas, Jupyter Notebook) – if used
- BI tool for dashboards (Power BI / Tableau / Looker Studio)

## Project Structure

- `data/` – sample data files (CSV or SQL)
- `sql/` – database schema and analysis queries
- `notebooks/` – Python notebooks for extra analysis and charts
- `dashboard/` – dashboard file(s)
- `images/` – screenshots of the dashboard
- `README.md` – project description and documentation

## Example Business Questions

- How much revenue does the restaurant make per day or month?
- Which menu items generate the most revenue?
- What is the average ticket size per order?
- Which items have the best or worst profit margin?

## Status

Work in progress: I am using this project to practice SQL, data modeling, and dashboard creation for a data analyst role.
